Since the problem statement was to create classes which would have functionalities of an ATM bank , I have planned on using a map data structure for it. 
We can put the key as the username of that user and other details of that user i.e the object created,  can be the value of that key.
So whenever we pass that as the argument in different functions,  we can access those variables , like balance etc . 
We can have various functions for performing actions like withdrawal or adding amount to the balance .
